# Dreamer (Diffusion DSLM)

TODO: Write content for **Dreamer (Diffusion DSLM)**.

- **Job**: Visually sketch and maintain Cond8 Directors as structured, image-like compositions. Rather than worrying about exact syntax or precise logic, the Dreamer treats each Director as a cohesive visual structure, like a blueprint or pixel art, clearly bounded by initialization (`init`) at the top and finalization (`fin`) at the bottom.
- **Style**: Loose, intuitive, and creative. It excels at rapidly visualizing pipelines and imagining new roles or actors—even those that don't yet exist. The Dreamer doesn’t require token-by-token precision; instead, it ensures that the overall visual integrity and structure remain coherent across hundreds of Directors simultaneously.
- **Why Visual?**: Viewing Directors as images leverages the natural strengths of Diffusion models, enabling efficient maintenance and exploration of large-scale, structured codebases without overwhelming VRAM constraints.
