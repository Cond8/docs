# Carpenter (Autoregressive DSLM)

TODO: Write content for **Carpenter (Autoregressive DSLM)**.

- **Job**: Precisely implement each Actor within Directors. Takes the visually sketched "dreams" and translates them into executable, correct code. It rigorously validates syntax, ensures type correctness, and guarantees that every Actor compiles, passes tests, and integrates cleanly into the Cond8 infrastructure.
- **Style**: Methodical, strict, and precise. If the Dreamer envisions something creative like `StoreActors.Compactify('SecretKey')`, the Carpenter ensures this Actor is accurately implemented, throwing errors immediately if anything doesn't match specifications.
- **Why Autoregressive?**: The Carpenterâ€™s autoregressive nature enforces strict correctness, bridging the gap between imaginative visual structures and robust, production-ready code.
