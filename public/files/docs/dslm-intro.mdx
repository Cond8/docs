## What is a DSLM?

> In the scientific world, DLSMs are often called "agents," but that term doesn’t fit within the COND8 vocabulary.

A **Domain-Specific Language Model (DSLM)** is a language model—small or large—customized or constrained for specific domain tasks. It doesn't necessarily need to be a specialized, fine-tuned model; a general-purpose model like ChatGPT can function as a DSLM when guided by carefully crafted prompts that enforce domain-specific constraints. DSLMs are categorized into two primary types:

> NOTE: DSLM are not fine tuned to be chat models like ChatGPT. DSLM are text completion models.

### Director DSLM – Why Declarative?

Director DSLMs are typically **autoregressive language models**, meaning they generate text sequentially, one token at a time, with each token depending solely on previously generated context.

This autoregressive nature introduces constraints:

- **No foresight:** Models cannot anticipate future tokens or the complete structure during the initial stages of generation.
- **Incremental logic:** Effective generation depends on each token logically and naturally extending previous tokens.

A **declarative coding style** fits perfectly within these constraints because:

1. **Independence of statements:** Future code structure isn't needed to determine the current token.
2. **Natural structure progression:** The model isn't forced to anticipate or guess missing future components.
3. **Reduced conflicts:** Declarative syntax minimizes scenarios where earlier decisions negatively impact future generations, avoiding backtracking issues.

Thus, **Director Pages enforce incremental, declarative structures**, ensuring each token logically follows from the previous context without dependency on unseen future elements.

### Actor DSLM – Why Imperative?
> Unfortunately - Diffusion Language models aren't out yet. You can follow [Inception Labs](https://www.inceptionlabs.ai/) to get more updates about diffusion language models.

Actor DSLMs differ significantly from Directors—they use **diffusion-based models** capable of simultaneously analyzing entire functions or code blocks before generation.

These models offer distinct advantages:
- **Holistic context awareness:** They consider the complete function structure from the outset.
- **Structured decision-making:** Full visibility enables clear and precise logical flow.
- **Imperative logic clarity:** They are effective in executing defined steps, handling logic, and managing state within contained scopes.

Consequently, **imperative coding suits Actor DSLMs best** due to their ability to reason comprehensively about the entire functional context, unlike Director DSLMs' incremental constraints.

### Key distinctions:

- **Directors** declare **what** should happen (Declarative).
- **Actors** define **how** it should happen, step-by-step (Imperative).
